    <div><h2>Reasons why you should talk to a psychologist.</h2></div>
    <div><p>Some people are under the misapprehension that therapy is for wusses. This couldn’t be further from the truth.  In addition to creating a safe, confidential and non-judgmental space, therapists form a unique relationship with their clients.<br>Talking therapies can help all sorts of people in lots of different situations. You may also hear them referred to as counselling, talking treatments or psychological therapies.<br>

Therapy is for anyone who's going through a bad time or has emotional problems they need help with.

For many adults it may be the same or more effective than medication.</p></div>  <br><br><br><br>
    <h2>What is Addiction?</h2>
    <img src="img/addiction.webp">
    <p>
Addiction is both physical and mental inability to stop consuming a chemical, drug or substance, even though it is causing psychological and physical harm. The term addiction does not only refer to dependence on substances such as heroin or cocaine but it also refers to alcohols and over usage of prescribed drugs. A person who cannot stop taking a particular drug or chemical has a substance dependence. It is considered as a brain disease because drugs change the brain—they change its structure and how it works. <br>Addiction treatment is highly personalized and often requires the support of the individual’s community or family. This is the reason why we have complied and came up with this rehabilitation platform. You need us.

    <h2>Gender based violence?</h2>
    <img src="img/gender.jpg">
    <p>One characteristic of gender-based violence is that it knows no social or economic boundaries and affects women and girls of all socio-economic backgrounds: this issue needs to be addressed in both developing and developed countries.
        <br>The numbers are staggering:

<br><br><br>35% of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence.
<br><br>Globally, 7% of women have been sexually assaulted by someone other than a partner.
<br><br>Globally, as many as 38% of murders of women are committed by an intimate partner.
<br><br>200 million women have experienced female genital mutilation/cutting.
<br><br>This issue is not only devastating for survivors of violence and their families, but also entails significant social and economic costs. In some countries, violence against women is estimated to cost countries up to 3.7% of their GDP – more than double what most governments spend on education.

Failure to address this issue also entails a significant cost for the future.
